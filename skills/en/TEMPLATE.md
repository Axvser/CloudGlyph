# Cloud Glyph Skills

## Responsibility

Strictly follow the workflow defined in this SKILL to produce Wiki documentation that meets specifications

## Variable Conventions

> CloudGlyph_Git:[https://github.com/Axvser/CloudGlyph][ReadOnly][Template Repository] - Cloud Glyph repository address

> CloudGlyph_Child_Git:[request] - Local Wiki repository root. This Wiki repository is an independent repo created from the Cloud Glyph:[Template Repository]. It is not counted in Wiki analysis or writing.

> Project_Root:[request] - Root directory of the project to be documented

> MainSKILL_Path:[CloudGlyph_Child_Git/skills/SKILL.md] - Path to the current skill

> Wiki_Root:[CloudGlyph_Child_Git/src/CloudGlyph/Assets/Docs/content/{languages}/] - Root directory for output documentation, dynamically divided by language.

> LanguageMap_List:[CloudGlyph_Child_Git/src/CloudGlyph/Assets/Docs/config/languages.json] - Range of languages supported by the Wiki

> LanguageTargets_List:[request] - Range of languages the user wants the Wiki to support

## Structure Conventions

⚙ {ID}_{PageName}/ - Folder naming convention when producing Markdown. The tree structure formed by folders is the directory structure the final App renders for the Wiki.

⚙ index.md - Each {ID}_{PageName}/ must have exactly one fixed-name index.md file, otherwise the directory structure will be incomplete. md files may be left blank. More subdirectories can be added to represent sub-items.

Ultimately, the directory will present the following structure. These are five fixed dimensions, and /.../ means you may extend sub-items and add content based on specific functional divisions under the dimension, with no depth limit.

> Wiki_Root/0_Welcome/

> Wiki_Root/1_QuickStart/.../

> Wiki_Root/2_API/.../

> Wiki_Root/3_SE_Analysis/.../

> Wiki_Root/4_Copyright/.../

## Accessibility Conventions

⚙ Respect content explicitly marked as non-public in the source code; avoid exposing such content in the Wiki

⚙ Avoid exposing sensitive information in the Wiki, such as passwords, keys, personal information, etc.
